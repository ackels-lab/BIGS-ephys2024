# BIGS-ephys2024

Congratulations, you made it to the practical session! Today our focus lies on extracellular recordings.

We will be using this Google Colab notebook which will take care of accessing and walking us through the data:

The aim of the workshop is to explore a high density extracellular unit recording dataset with respect to:
- Task 1: Assessing quality of the sorted units using firing rate
- Task 2: Analysing overall firing rates recorded in different brain regions
- Task 3: Analyze neural responses to change in visual stimuli
- Task 4: Analyze neural responses to optotagging stimuli

There are some amazing datasets out there that are publicly available to explore, dive into and play around with. A very popular resource for this is the Allen Brain Institute. In this session, we will be using the "**Visual Behavior Neuropixels data"** to get some first-hand experience on how to work with extracelluar unit recordings.
As the name suggests, these were recorded using high-density Neuropixels probes with hundreds of individual electrodes.

The data is provided in the Neural Data without Borders (NWB) format. You can learn more about it here: https://www.nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/
